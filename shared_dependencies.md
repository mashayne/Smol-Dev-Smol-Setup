Shared Dependencies:

1. **setup_script.py**: This is the main script file. It will use functions like `install_packages()`, `configure_environment()`, `handle_errors()`, and `customize_setup()`. It will also use data from `config.json` and `requirements.txt`.

2. **requirements.txt**: This file contains a list of software packages to be installed. It is used by the `install_packages()` function in `setup_script.py`.

3. **config.json**: This file contains configuration settings and environment variables. It is used by the `configure_environment()` function in `setup_script.py`.

4. **user_guide.md**, **docs/installation.md**, **docs/configuration.md**, **docs/customization.md**, **docs/error_handling.md**, **docs/compatibility.md**, **docs/performance.md**, **docs/security.md**, **docs/interface.md**: These documentation files will share a common structure and will reference the functions and variables used in `setup_script.py` and `config.json`. They will also use common terms and definitions.

5. **Common Terms and Definitions**: These include "installation", "configuration", "customization", "error handling", "compatibility", "performance", "security", "interface", and "user guide". These terms will be used across all files.

6. **Common Variables**: These include the operating system type (`os_type`), software packages (`packages`), configuration settings (`config_settings`), and environment variables (`env_vars`). These variables will be used in `setup_script.py`, `config.json`, and the documentation files.

7. **Common Functions**: These include `install_packages()`, `configure_environment()`, `handle_errors()`, and `customize_setup()`. These functions will be used in `setup_script.py` and referenced in the documentation files.
