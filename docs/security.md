# Security

The Smol Developer Setup Script is designed with security in mind. It ensures the protection of sensitive information during the setup process.

## Protection of Sensitive Information

Sensitive information such as environment variables and configuration settings are stored in `config.json`. This file should be kept secure and not shared publicly.

## Error Handling

The `handle_errors()` function in `setup_script.py` is designed to catch and handle any errors that occur during the setup process. This includes errors that may occur during the installation of software packages or the configuration of the development environment.

## User Permissions

The setup script should be run with the appropriate user permissions to ensure that it can install software packages and configure the environment correctly. However, it should not be run with more permissions than necessary to reduce the risk of security issues.

## Updates and Patches

The `install_packages()` function in `setup_script.py` ensures that all software packages are up-to-date. This includes installing any necessary updates or patches, which can help to fix security vulnerabilities.

## Security Practices

Developers using the setup script should follow good security practices. This includes keeping all software up-to-date, using strong passwords, and following the principle of least privilege.

For more information on how to use the setup script, refer to `user_guide.md`. For details on installation, configuration, customization, error handling, compatibility, performance, and interface, refer to the respective documentation files in the `docs/` directory.
