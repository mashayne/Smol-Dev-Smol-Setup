# Error Handling in Smol Developer Setup Script

Error handling is a crucial part of the Smol Developer Setup Script. It ensures that the script can handle unexpected situations gracefully and provide useful feedback to the user.

## Overview

The main script file, `setup_script.py`, uses a function called `handle_errors()` to manage any issues that arise during the installation and configuration process.

## How It Works

The `handle_errors()` function is designed to catch exceptions that may occur during the execution of the script. It uses Python's built-in error handling mechanisms to do this.

Here's a simplified example of how it might look:

```python
def handle_errors():
    try:
        # Code that might raise an exception
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this example, if an error occurs during the execution of the code within the `try` block, the `except` block will catch it. The error message will then be printed to the console.

## Common Errors

Here are some common errors that might occur during the setup process, and how the script handles them:

- **Installation Errors**: If a software package fails to install, the script will catch the error, print a message, and stop the installation process.

- **Configuration Errors**: If there's a problem with the `config.json` file (like a missing or incorrect value), the script will catch the error, print a message, and stop the configuration process.

- **Operating System Errors**: If the script is run on an unsupported operating system, it will catch the error, print a message, and stop the script.

## What To Do If You Encounter An Error

If you encounter an error while running the script, the first step is to read the error message. It will often give you a clue about what went wrong.

Next, check the `user_guide.md` for any additional information about the error.

If you're still having trouble, you can open an issue on the project's GitHub page. Be sure to include the error message and any other relevant information.

Remember, the goal of the Smol Developer Setup Script is to make setting up a development environment as easy as possible. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help.
